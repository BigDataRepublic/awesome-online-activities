## What the movie
It has been around for year and the concept is simple: you get a single screenshot from a movie and try to guess the title. One member shares the screen, while the rest tries to guess.

## Reverse pictionary

A bit like the classic pictionary game, but in reverse. Everybody has pen and paper and draws. One team member will, while drawing a movie title or concept, explain what they are doing: "I'm drawing a line up, and straight through that line, another line half way up", etc.

The other team members will follow that lead and try to draw the same, while guessing the subject. First right guess wins!

Don't forget to share your drawing at the end of the game.

## Online fox-hunt
One team member walks to a random local location, the rest of the team tries to guess where that person is. Restrict answers to yes/no to make it harder.
