# How to contribute
Add a simple markdown description file to either the `list/platform` or `list/social` folder and create a PR.

- `list/platform`: is for anything that requires all conference call members to log in and/or join a platform online to enjoy the activity.
- `list/social`: only a few people need to log on to a platform and/or a platform is not required at all.
