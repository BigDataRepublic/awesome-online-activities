To get away from the grind of pushing tasks to the done column, you need online activities that fit your team and engages everybody.

This is a curated list of online activities you can try with your team. Feel free to send a PR if you have anything to add.

Happy teaming!

# Social activities

Social activities do not require everybody in the conference call to join an online platform to enjoy the event.

## Reverse pictionary

A bit like the classic pictionary game, but in reverse. Everybody has pen and paper and draws. One team member will, while drawing a movie title or concept, explain what they are doing: "I'm drawing a line up, and straight through that line, another line half way up", etc.

The other team members will follow that lead and try to draw the same, while guessing the subject. First right guess wins!

Don't forget to share your drawing at the end of the game.

## Number42 demo pub quizzes
Company supplying pub quizzes also has a few online examples.

One shares his/her screen (with audio) and opens one of the example quizzes at

## What the movie
It has been around for years and the concept is simple: you get a single screenshot from a movie and try to guess the title.

One member shares the screen, while the rest tries to guess.

# Platform activities

Platform activities require everybody in the conference call to join the online platform to enjoy the event.
